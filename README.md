# AI-Powered Magic 8-Ball ðŸŽ±

This is an AI-powered version of the classic Magic 8-Ball, built using Rust, WebAssembly, JavaScript, and Hugging Face's language models. Ask a question, and receive an answer either generated by an AI model or a classic random response.

## Features
- **AI Integration:** Uses Hugging Face's GPT-2 model to generate context-aware responses.
- **WebAssembly:** Core logic for the Magic 8-Ball is implemented in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for performance.
- **Fallback Responses:** If the AI model is unavailable or the API key is missing, the app falls back to traditional random Magic 8-Ball responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Rust and Cargo:** Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can install them from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- **wasm-pack:** Install `wasm-pack` to build the Rust project into WebAssembly.
  ```sh
  cargo install wasm-pack
```

Python (optional): If you want to serve the project locally, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server.

## Installation

Clone the Repository:

```sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pgw-code/magic_8.git
cd your-repository-name

```

Build the Rust Code:

```sh
wasm-pack build --target web
```

Serve the Application Locally: You can use Python to serve the application locally:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
```

## Usage
Open the application in your browser.
Enter your Hugging Face API key in the provided field.
Type a question and click the "Shake the 8-Ball" button.
The AI will generate a response based on your question. If the AI is unavailable, a traditional Magic 8-Ball response will be displayed.
